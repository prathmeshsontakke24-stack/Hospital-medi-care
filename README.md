## 🔌 API Integration

The project uses Axios for fetching doctor and healthcare-related data.

### Why Axios?

* Easy HTTP requests
* Automatic JSON transformation
* Better error handling
* Request and response interceptors
* Cleaner syntax than Fetch API

Example:

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

const response = await axios.get(
  "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
);

console.log(response.data);
```

3. User clicks "Book Appointment".
4. Appointment form opens.
5. User enters required details.
6. Form validation checks data.
